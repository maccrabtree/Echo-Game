# Echo-Game
A game made in a 48-hour game jam for OUGDA

The idea of the game was inspired by the theme "What do we do now?"
The best way to describe the gameplay is a "hidden" Simon Says, where each scene starts as a blank slate.
The player of the game is only presented with the controls to use (for keyboard "A S D F G" and for the Rock Band Drum Set all of the drum pads and bass pedal). 
After being presented with the blank scene, the player hits key until they find the first part of the pattern, to which a layer of sound is built and an object in the scene appears, either a jellyfish or a teacup or a piece of cake. 
Then, it is the player's job to remember the first correct note, and then find the next piece of the pattern. On a wrong hit, 
the music is muted and the objects disappear, until the player gets the whole pattern correct and moves on to the next level.

The complexity of the code came from enabling/disabling multiple pieces of objects, along with sounds in a manner that would start and layer appropriately.
