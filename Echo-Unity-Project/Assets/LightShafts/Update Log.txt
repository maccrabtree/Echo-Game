Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.6.1(hotfix):

-New scene demo, old one was corrupt.
-Changed tool tip message for animation toggle.
-Changed some lines in the manual.


Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.6:

-Removed old animation system: -per shaft rotation.
							   -per generator rotation.
 This old system used animation files, which where to performance intensive in large amounts.
 
-New native supported animation. The shafts are now animated from within the source code, this is much more performance friendly and gives a more natural feel.
-Set new animation speed. The speed of each rotation axis can be set.
-Programmable animation. The animation speed can be changed throug scripting.
-added new info to the manual.
-Generator now spawns at the editor camera's location.



Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.5.3.2(hotfix):

-Fixed mesh bug (same as former update, now with the correct file).
 You should now be able to correctly set the meshes in the required slot.



Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.5.3.1(hotfix):

-Fixed system crashing bug that prevented shaft meshes from loading.



Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.5.3:


Updates:	 	 Complete New Inspector Layout!
				
				-Reworked complete inspector so every variable goes trough the GeneratorExtension script.
				-Added tooltips (extra text on hover over variable component) so the user gets extra information of the current function.
				-Made some name/type changes to components in the LightShaftScaling script to support the new editor script setup.
				-Moved shaft space variable under shaft width variable, these belong in the same category.
				-Moved random up/width above up/width angle/spread to have a more logical layout.
				-Editor script (GeneratorExtension)now handles the inspect in 3 phases: 1 cast selection/setup, 2 shaft settings, 3 optimization settings.
				-Put all 3 phases in fold down menus. All settings the belong to their face can be hidden under the fold down. This gives a more stream lined layout and
				 users can work in steps.
				-Important material and mesh setup moved above the Phase setup fold menus. This is because these are the two crucial parts, without them the system
				 will not function properly.
				-Crucial parts of the setup are now market yellow.
				-All slots now have a corresponding type, so no mistakes can be made anymore by placing a wrong type of object in a slot.
								    
				-Added mobile preset support. Users no longer have to manually change to source code to enable mobile support.
				-Above update makes it possible to add a larger amount of shaft with the same performance.

BugFixes: 		-If no hit was detected within the Maximum range shafts would shrink to unrealistic small sizes. Fixed: When no hit is detected
				 the shafts will be properly given the MaxDistance as a scale.

				-Falloff went haiwire when mobile build was enabled: Created two falloff types, automatically switches between settings in the background. Same option visible for user.





Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.5.2:

Updates:		-User can now set Falloff. With this the user able to set how sharp light should be cut off.
				 This can be very soft (fading will be visible) or sharp (like real light).
				-Updated the user Manual.
				 
				 
BugFixes:		-Cone casting's shape was not correct.



Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.5.1:

Updates:		-Added Generator animation.
				-Added per shaft animation.
				-New Error log when AnimationOn is on but no animation is detected.
				-Mesh cast now also supports all casting angles and spreads.
				-added model to the player in example scene.


Bugfixes:		-Collision detection tried to read texture of non readable objects: Added extra checkup to see if object has the correct collider and texture settings.


Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.5:

Updates:		-Added cone shape casting. This could be used for car lights, flashlights, etc.
				-updated the manual.
				-Removed SharedMaterial. Reason: When more than one system was in the scene, the sharedmaterial overrides all other settings of the independent systems.
				 causing wrong color values to emerge and screw up the end results.
				-Cylinder casts can now be morphed into a vortex shape.
				-Added new debugging error messages.
				-Regular casts spreading width can now be set.
				-Regular cast  spreading up width can now be set.
				-Renamed FixedXangle to UpAngle.
				-Updated shaft texture settings to prevent hard texture edges.
				-Completely removed animation support, there was no performance friendly way to animate mesh casted shafts.
				-Normal (square) cast,ConeCast and cylinder cast can now be rotated in editor to fit casting direction.
				-Removed the Cylinders 'wallcasting' options. Because of above updates this can now be set dynamically.
				-Moved vortex casting under cylinder cast
				-tweaked shaft texture (can be switched with custom one).
				-Added all new systems to the editor preview function.
				-New example scene.
				-Created ambient audio for example scene.
				-Renamed 'enable meshCast' to MeshCast.
				-Baked most of the example scene's lighting to save memory.
				

Bugfixes: 		-Random up angle not showing
				-Could not cast from dynamic angles. Fixed with the new system implementation (featured in the update list).
				-Vortex not showing correctly.
				-Inspector not working correctly. Fixed bug in menu script.




Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.4.1.1:

Hotfix: -Dissabled mesh animation untill a bether way is found to compute the positions.
		-Fixed minor bug in generator script.



Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.4.1:

Updates:		-Performance update. When no real time color sample is selected all shafts will share their material.
				 This is prevents the creation of multiple clone materials and has also an advantage in mobile builds.
				 (Real time sampling can not be applied in mobile builds.)
				 
				-Updated Manual information.



Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.4:

Updates:		-Mesh casting. The user can now place a mesh for the system to use. Shafts will be spawned on every vertex position.
			
				-Mesh scaling (only applied to the position of the casted shafts, because no actual mesh is used).

				-Added option toggle for outward casting on mesh cast.

				-outward casting, this will cast rays in every direction of the mesh its vertices,thus shaping it in shaft form. (this will override, Random Up, Width and 
				 Fixed Angle).
				
				-Back casting, This will mimic the light shafts from the sun or any light source in the shape of the selected mesh. Unlike Outward casting
				 this won't override other settings except shaft space.
				 
				-Side casting, This will mimic the light shafts from the sun or any light source in the shape of the selected mesh. Unlike Outward casting
				 this won't override other settings except shaft space.
				 
				-Animated mesh casting. (very intensive).
				
				-Renamed GeneratorPreview script to GeneratorExtension.js.
				
				-Updated manual with new info.
				
				-Cylinder casting  overrides shaft space value with its radius.
				
				-Fixed crash when making use of the new mesh system. Switched script lines to new locations.
				
				-New way of spawning the generator.
				
				-Added menu button under, GameObjects-Create Other-LightShafts.
				
				-Gizmo now derived from gizmo folder (automatically created on first spawn of the first generator).
				
				-Renamed LightShaftPlane to LightShaftMesh.
				
				
				
				




Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.3:

Updates:		-Changed delete shaft sets button to delete shafts 
	
				-The user can now press preview and it will automatically refresh the shafts.
				
				-Shafts are now childed under the subchild of the generator, this makes it possible for the delete button to delete all shafts at 
				 once and for the preview button to refresh properly.
				
				-The generator refreshes the shafts when entering play mode to prevent double casting.
				
				-The systems deletes the current shafts spawned ingame when returning to edit mode, to view again inside the editor press the preview button.
				
				-MaxDistance is now called MaxCastDistance.
				
				-Added cylinder casting from the wall and cylinder casting from the roof or floor.
				
				-3 new select buttons for the type of cast you want.
				
				-Cylinder radius is now an inspector variable only visible when a cylinder type is selected.
				
				-Added label naming.
				
				-Added progress bar.
				
				-Added Serializing to the editor class for saving the editor toggle states.
				
				-Added multiple axis cylinder casting.(x,y,z).
				
				
				
				
Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.2

Updates:

System upgrade!:	-New shader code: it doesn't use alpha channels any more, created new additive blending. This creates more realistic light colors.

					-Added Intensity slider. This controls the new transparency and color brightness.
					
					- Editor previewing! Created editor buttons for previewing settings.
										 no longer do you have to start up your whole scene to check out your shafts.
										 This will make placing and editing the shafts much more convenient.
					 
					-Mobile support: because of above changes the system can be tweaked to run optimal on mobile devices.
					
					-Linux and OSX support: New shader can be run completely in OpenGL.
					
					-Made some changes to the interface of the inspector: new buttons, moved some variables from position to fit a more step to step workflow.
					 It goes from color setup to casting in order.
					 
					-Updated manual with new explanations.
					
					-Added new screenshots to the store page.
					


Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.1

Updates:

-Cleaned up shader code.

-Added new static shaft casting. The user can now specify if shafts are dynamic or not (they won't collide).
 If they are static more of them can be batched and a higher number of casts can be used with little to no
 memory impact.

-Added new function explanation to the Manual.


Bugfixes:

-Shafts sometimes casted weird. fixed by reconfiguring the cast axis.


Alzheimer Lightshafts 1.0

-Release on Asset store.
